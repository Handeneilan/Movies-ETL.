# Movies-ETL.

## Overview

The goal of this analysis is to create automated pipeline that extracts, transform and loads data. For this analysis, we used the following breakdown:

 -write an ETL function to read three data files,
 
 -extract and transform the Wikipedia data,
 
 -extract and transform the Kaggle and rating data,
 
 -load the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database.
 
 ## Summary
 
ETL function helped us to collect and clean the data that we get from different resources. It allowed us to transform the data, merge it and upload on to PostgreSQL as dataset to be used in our analysis.
